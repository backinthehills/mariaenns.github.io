            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>Maria Enns is a writer, educator, and artist living on a family farm in southwest Saskatchewan. She holds a Bachelor of Education in Arts Education from the University of Regina and has taught in schools, galleries, and as a homeschool parent. Her writing has appeared in peer-reviewed journals, and she facilitates art workshops through her local art gallery.
            <br><br>
            As an elder at her local church and workshop leader, Maria combines practical teaching experience with spiritual leadership and community connection. Having lived in both rural and urban settings, she brings a unique perspective on how connection to nature provides spiritual and emotional sustenance. Her work explores the intersection of faith, ecology, and everyday life on the Canadian prairies.
            <br><br>
            Back in the Hills grew from a homeschool botany project with her children into a deeper exploration of belonging, healing, and the sacred in the landscape. Maria lives with her husband Charles and their two children on the same prairie hills she writes about, where she continues to walk the cow paths and tend to the quiet places of her soul.</p>
